## Description

Plan out your day with this work day scheduler. Save what you want to work on for that hour and see your progress as the day goes on. See what happened in the past, what's happening now, and what would happen in the future. Need to turn away? No need to worry, we'll save your progress so that you can come back and pick up where you left off.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
